Standardized, human-readable trust agreements and NDAs

# Trust Agreements Project

This site hosts plain-language, versioned trust agreements and NDAs for open collaboration, respectful access, and ethical testing.

🌐 Live site: [https://trustagreements.org](https://trustagreements.org)

## Agreements

- [`Basic NDA v1`](https://trustagreements.org/basic-v1.html) – Keep private things private. Don’t share, copy, or reverse-engineer.

## Mission

We believe legal friction shouldn't be a barrier to trust. These agreements are open, readable, and ready for reuse — so people and systems can work together safely.

## License

All agreements and site content are in the public domain (CC0). You are free to use, reference, remix, or embed them — no permission needed.
